# React Boilerplate

This is my boilerplate to start a new project in React.

## Structure

I like to split my project into 3 different themes :
- [/views](./src/views) with a specific file for each URL
- [/components](./src/components) with all the component used inside the project
- [/actions](./src/actions), [/constants](./src/constants) and [/stores](./src/stores) to manage all my data interactions (with an external API)
