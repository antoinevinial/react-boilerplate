# React Boilerplate

This is my boilerplate to start a new project in React.

## Structure

I like to split my project into 3 different themes :
- [/views](./src/views) with a specific file for each URL
- /components with all the component used inside the project
- /actions, /constants and /stores to manage all my data interactions (with an external API)
